/* CHALLENGE: write a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary.

  JS NOTES (Bitwise):
  >>>	Zero fill right shift
  <<	Zero fill left shift; The first operand is an integer, the second integer is the # of bits of the first operand to be shifted to the left. 
  >>	Signed right shift; the first operand is an integer, the second operand is the # of bits of the first operand to be shifted to the right. 

  BINARY NOTES (base 2):
    1 => 1
    2 => 10
    3 => 11
    4 => 100
    5 => 101
